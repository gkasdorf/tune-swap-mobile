# TuneSwap Mobile
iOS and Android application for [TuneSwap](https://tuneswap.app) build using Expo.

## API
If you are interested in how swaps are made for different services (perhaps Tidal for example as there is no public API for Tidal), see the 
[TuneSwap API repo](https://github.com/gkasdorf/tune-swap-api).

## Router
This is built using the new Expo Router library. For information, see the [Expo Router docs](https://expo.github.io/router/docs/).

## TypeScript
The mobile application has been refactored to use TypeScript. This is still a work in progress and the refactoring is far from complete. There are many apsects of the codebase that 
are not properly typed at this point.
